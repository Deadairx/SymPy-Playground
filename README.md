# SymPy Playground

A personal playground for trying out SymPy, a Python library for symbolic mathematics.

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the example file:
```bash
python3 example.py
```

This will demonstrate basic SymPy functionality including:
- Symbolic arithmetic
- Differentiation
- Integration
- Equation solving

Feel free to modify `example.py` or create new files to experiment with SymPy!
